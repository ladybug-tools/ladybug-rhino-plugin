# ladybug-rhino
Ladybug plugin for Rhino 6

Ladybug for Rhino will bring Ladybug functionalities to Rhino (without using Grasshopper).

The code in this repository is:
1. only a proof of concept! Test it on your own risk.
2. only functional in Rhino 6. It won't work in Rhino 5 or older versions of Rhino.

- [ ] ...
